# mod_r3d_pannellum
Joomla 3.6.x Module to render 3D Panoramic Images &amp; Videos by integrating Pannellum 2.3 
 
Testinstallation can be viewed here: http://git.h13k.de
 
So far, equirectangular, cubemap, multires and video (using video.js) are working with ALL available parameters available in the Joomla backend - planning to add scenes and hotspots. 
Feel free to join. I am more of a photographer then a coder.
